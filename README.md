# MakeItSoFinance: A Personal Finance Tracker

A web-based budgeting and expense tracking app built during a short hackathon sprint.  
The project explores how people can quickly set budgets, record transactions, and see how their actual spending compares â€” all in one place.

---

## What it does
- Create and manage **monthly budgets** with customizable categories.  
- Add **transactions** manually or bring them in from a mock data source.  
- Compare **budgeted vs actual spending** at a glance.  
- Export data for external use or analysis.  

---

## Why we built it
Personal finance tools can be overly complex or feel like spreadsheets.  
We wanted to prototype a simple, approachable experience that lets users focus on **planning and awareness** instead of wrestling with numbers.

---

## Tech stack
- **Web-based** (built with JavaScript frameworks and libraries).  
- **Database** for storing budgets, categories, and transactions.  
- **Mock API** simulates bank transaction imports.  
- **Charts and tables** provide quick insight into spending.  

---

## Current focus
For this prototype we concentrated on the **budgeting features** first:
- Creating monthly budgets.
- Tracking actual spending.
- Highlighting when categories go over budget.

Transaction imports and categorization rules are being explored as follow-up features.

## Team
Built in ~1.5 business days by a four-person team using AI-assisted coding tools.
